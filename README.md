An application launcher in Python.
Inspired by <https://github.com/Biont/sway-launcher-desktop/>,
but the code is mine. I personally think Python is a lot easier
to read than a bunch of shell script + sed/awk, so I created this.
It does not depend on sway or wayland, but I use it for sway,
hence the name ;-P
